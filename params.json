Optimizing and efficiently serving the static resources (JS, HTML, CSS, Images etc.) significantly increases client side performance. This Java Library provides web components to help you speed up Front-End of your J2EE application.\r\n\r\nIt is said that 80% of the end-user response time is spent on the front-end. To make the front-end efficient and friendly to the browser, various [Performance Practices](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html) have been suggested. We can measure page performance using tools such as [YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) or [Page Speed](http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/). These tools validate page against the best practices and give the performance ratings/grade. WebUtilities provides inbuilt J2EE components to apply some of those best practices in your web application with minimal change to speed it up and get higher performance score. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n*   Serve multiple JS or CSS files in one request\r\n*   Add Expires header for JS, CSS and Image files to be cached by browser\r\n*   Minify JS, CSS files on the fly\r\n*   Minify Inline CSS and JS code blocks\r\n*   Add Character Encoding to your response\r\n*   Server compressed contents (gzip/compress/deflate)\r\n*   Cache responses to speed loading by avoiding reprocessing \r\n\r\n### Get started\r\n\r\n*   Refer [Getting Started wiki] (https://github.com/rpatil26/webutilities/wiki/)\r\n*   Configure your `web.xml` with [chain of filters] (https://github.com/rpatil26/webutilities/wiki/chaining) accordingly. \r\n   \r\nFor more examples and step by step Guide, Visit [Wiki](https://github.com/rpatil26/webutilities/wiki/). For any issues or have feature suggestions, report them [here] (https://github.com/rpatil26/webutilities/issues).\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nWebUtilities uses Maven to manage the dependencies. Please refer the maven [Artifact Details] (http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Ccom.googlecode.webutilities%7Cwebutilities%7C0.0.7%7Cjar) for the list of dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Difference \r\n| Without Webutilities  | With Webutilities |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n|![](http://rawgit.com/rpatil26/webutilities/gh-pages/images/before.png)|![](http://rawgit.com/rpatil26/webutilities/gh-pages/images/after.png)|\r\n","google":"UA-16451225-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
